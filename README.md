# MP3-
This is one of my earliest Python projects — a simple MP3 player built using pygame.mixer for audio playback. No GUI frameworks like Tkinter were used — just pure Pygame. It can play .mp3 files from your local system with basic controls. A beginner project that helped me understand how Python handles sound and user interaction.
